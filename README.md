# mystery-grids
This is a program that I used that slowly creates pixel art. It's a guessing game to play with people to see who can get it first.



Here is what a blank grid looks like:

|1| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| ---|--- |--- |--- | ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---|--- |---|---|---|---|---|---| --- | ---|
|2| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
 |3| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
 | 4| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 5| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 6| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 7| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 8| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 9| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 10| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 11| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 12| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 13| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| 14| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
 |15 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|16 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|17 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|18 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|19 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|20| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
||A|B|C|D |E |F |G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|


You type in or (copy + paste) csv strings of grids that you want to be the same color. The color will then be randomized and then drawn when you're ready.

Ex:
Color 1:
```
A1, B1-2, C1-4, C7, D1-7, D13, E1-8, E12, E18, F1-9, F11-13, F17-18, G1-4, G7-13, G17-18, H1-2, H5-13, H15-18, I3-13, I15-18, J1-9, J11-14, J16-18, K1-4, K13-14, K16-17, L1-2, L14, L16, M1, M11, M14, M15, N14, O14-15, P15-16
```
Color 2:
```
J10-11, K5-12, L6-10, L12-13, M5-6, M9-10, M12-13, N4-6, N9-12, O4-5, O10, P10
```
Color 3:
```
H14, I14, J15, K15, L15, N8
```
Run the code to see what Halloween thing this is.
